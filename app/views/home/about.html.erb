  <h3>About TEDx, x = independently organized event </h3>
  
  <p>
  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized 
  events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx 
  event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and 
  connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded 
  TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference 
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are 
  self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

  <h3>About TED</h3>
  
  <p>
  TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a 
  four-day conference in California 25 years ago, TED has grown to support those 
  world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. The annual TED Conference invites 
  the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes. Their talks are 
  then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Al 
  Gore, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan 
  Nilekani,Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and UK Prime 
  Minister Gordon Brown. The annual TED Conference takes place in Long Beach, 
  California, with simulcast in Palm Springs; TEDGlobal is held each year in Oxford, 
  UK. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted 
  daily, and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive 
  transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers 
  worldwide. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional 
  individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their 
  wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, 
  self-organized events around the world, and the TEDFellows program, helping 
  world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED 
  community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and 
  activities.
